	On Running / 15.04.2025, 11:08
</h3>
  <p>
	I think I've been running for almost 13 years now. In fact, I've just confirmed this on my Nike Run Club app.

  <figcaption>Behold, my first run with the Jozi chapter of Nike Run Club in October 2012, and a more recent run (right). I'm proud of the improvement but it's also meaningless.</figcaption>
  
  <p>
	What started as a counterweight to my chain smoking and binge drinking has turned into something so much more. As I look towards what I want from running in the future, I felt like I needed to take a few minutes to get my thoughts straight.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	I've come a long way since the days of sucking down a cigarette immediately after a wheezy and painful run. Speeds that felt impossible back then feel sluggish today even at triple the distance. With little training or conscious effort I've improved consistently, and that's what I want to talk about in this post‚Äîrunning as leisure vs. running as a medium for self-actualisation. Experience vs. achievement.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	I've shared the joy of running with so many people, from the original Nike Run Club crews of Jozi, to strangers along Maybachufer, to dozens of fellow runners on Instagram. I can fully credit the Rosebank Run Club with getting me hooked on running, but since those first few group runs I've been running 100% solo. I've entered several events and half marathons and failed to attend a single one. I say that I usually get sick or injured a few days before, but the truth is, I bail because I realise I have no interest in taking part in a group milestone challenge. I'm not against goals or personal improvement, rather against the idea of placing a grail at the end of an intrinsically rewarding activity‚Äîlike starting yoga only to become a yoga instructor, or monetising your ceramics hobby.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	Over the years more and more people have encouraged me to try out half marathons or to beat my PB, as if the pure act of going outside and running around for a while is unfathomable as a reward in itself. I guess I'm writing this to my future self, as well as to anyone else who enjoys running, or hopes to get into running. I want to remind you (me) that running IS the goal and the reward. Running is where I listen to books, running is where I cried for kilometres after the death of my Dad, running is how I explore cities and nature without leaving a mark.
	</p>	 
<p>	
Of course I'm interested in the metrics my watch provides, and proud of the distances I can reach, but turning something that should be experienced into something to be achieved risks becoming the reason you run, instead of the... you know... running? I love thinking back to my first run and thanking that younger version of me for the gift.
