	On Running / 15.04.2025, 11:08
  </h3>
  <p>
	I think I've been running for almost 13 years now. In fact, I've just confirmed this on my Nike Run Club app.
  </p>

  <figcaption>Behold, my first run with the Jozi chapter of Nike Run Club in October 2012, and a more recent run (right). I'm proud of the improvement but it's also meaningless.</figcaption>
  
  <p>
	What started as a counterweight to my chain smoking and binge drinking has turned into something so much more. As I look towards what I want from running in the future, I felt like I needed to take a few minutes to get my thoughts straight.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	I've come a long way since the days of sucking down a cigarette immediately after a wheezy and painful run. Speeds that felt impossible back then feel sluggish today even at triple the distance. With little training or conscious effort I've improved consistently, and that's what I want to talk about in this postâ€”running as leisure vs. running as a medium for self-actualisation. Experience vs. achievement.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	I've shared the joy of running with so many people, from the original Nike Run Club crews of Jozi, to strangers along Maybachufer, to dozens of fellow runners on Instagram. I can fully credit the Rosebank Run Club with getting me hooked on running, but since those first few group runs I've been running 100% solo. I've entered several events and half marathons and failed to attend a single one. I say I usually get sick or injured a few days before, but the truth is, I bail because I realise I have no interest in taking part in a group milestone challenge. I'm not against goals or personal improvement, just the idea of placing a grail at the end of an intrinsically rewarding activityâ€”like starting yoga only to become a yoga instructor, or monetising your ceramics hobby.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	Over the years more and more people have encouraged me to try out half marathons or to beat my PB, as if the pure act of going outside and running around for a while is unfathomable as a reward in itself. I guess I'm writing this to my future self, as well as to anyone else who enjoys running, or hopes to get into running. I want to remind you (me) that running IS the goal and the reward. Running is where I listen to books, running is where I cried for kilometres after the death of my Dad, running is how I explore cities and nature. Of course I'm interested in the metrics my watch provides, and proud of the distances I can reach, but turning something that should be experienced into something to be achieved risks becoming the reason you run, instead of the... you know... running?

I haven't spent time on WOS in a while but I recently stubmled onto the wonderful <a class="inline" href="https://twitter.com/htmlenergy">HTML Energy</a> podcast and I've been inspired to keep going. I love that there are so many people out there doing the same kinda thing for so many different reasons.

	I haven't built a PC in 14 years. Here's my first attempt using scavenged parts from eBay-Kleinanzeigen. Unfortunately the RAM I purchased was not compatible with my mainboard but I'll be able to fix that soon.

	It has been an intense two weeks. Documenting my digital learning on here seemed like a frivolous act but I figured I could make it useful if I linked to some of the more important resources out there. Here are some I have found useful for life in May/June 2020. <mark>#BlackLivesMatter</mark>

	This morning I spent some time adjusting the padding of various elements on mobile. Turns out I left an enter class out of the mobile section of my CSS, meaning the padding wasn't updating no matter what I was changing. I don't know how people do this for a living. Anyways, marquee!

	I tried to change my current <mark>flexbox</mark> layout on mobile from showing 4 items really small in a row, or stacking everything in a single column, to showing 2 images in a row. I can't seem to wrap my head around it but I'll try again soon. I tweaked some mobile text sizes and image corner radii. I also added the artwork I made for Chemical Percussion â€“ a friend's music project. It was created in Blender using <a class="inline" href="https://www.abcdinamo.com/typefaces/favorit/">Dinamo's Favorit Lining</a> as a starting point. Happy with how distressed and noisy it looks ðŸ˜ˆ.

<p>
	Today I tried to figure <mark>flexbox</mark> out. I guess itâ€™s pretty straightforward but Iâ€™m not sure how to stop the padding between the items from padding around the sides too ðŸ¤” (other than padding the left of one object and right of the other). I should also create another class for images that will be in a flexbox instead of just reusing the â€˜figureâ€™ class I created for other images. Also, the damn footer keeps going off centre when I drag the window mobile size. I dunno. Thatâ€™s enough for today ðŸ¥±.

	I managed to get images onto the site, round their corners, and add a caption underneath. I then added a sticky footer that I found confusing for some reason. But it's there. I also added 2 links to the top of the page. Try them out.
