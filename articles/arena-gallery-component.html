		I’ve been a user and supporter of <a class="inline" href="http://www.are.na">Are.na</a> for years. I use it to store links, references, or images, and to explore the things that others choose to store in their channels. It also works as a janky CMS. I can drop content into a channel and then pull that content in elsewhere, like I’ve done below with some Javascript (thanks Claude).

		I connected a channel I started as a repository for press photos pulled from Techcrunch, a tech news website that I’m convinced future civilisations will look back on as a timeline of our demise. The 30+ images I’ve collected as of today, 9 April, 2025, are pulled from articles on VC funding at startups on Techcrunch since 1 January. Notice a patterns?
