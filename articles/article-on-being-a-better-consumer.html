<h3>
	On Being A Conscious Consumer / 22.04.2025, 11:24
</h3>

<p>Lately I've been trying to wriggle free of the tendrils of US hegemony, and let me tell you, this has not being going well. While I consider myself a conscious consumer I am also not willing to make the massive sacrifices that would keep my values intact.</p>

<p>I cycle everywhere but still fly home 3 times a year to see family at a cost of ~5t of CO2 per trip. I choose hotels over AirBnB, but still buy monthly staples (cat food, cat litter, detergent) via Amazon. I eat less meat and buy seasonal vegetables, yet devour digital content served up by harmful data centres.</p>

<p>As I battle these contradictions internally, I'm now trying to reduce my dependency on products from the USA and China, in favour of solutions based in Europe, Taiwan, South Korea, etc. Obviously this is a knee-jerk reaction to the madness that has consumed the USA recently, but it's one I'm grateful for as I had never really questioned these choices before. Shame on me. </p>

<p>To put it in perspective, here's a look at the monthly amounts I spend on digital services (both personal and professional) from the USA.</p>

<p>As you can see, this is a fucking disaster. This also fails to take into account the several apple devices I own, or the mountains of attention I give to Instagram for them to monetise. It doesn't account for the pairs of Nike running shoes I've been buying annually for the last 13 years of running. This hides purchases that may be indirectly funnelling my Euros to American holding companies.</p>

<p>I've managed to make a few small moves that I'm proud of, like borrowing audiobooks from Libby with a Berlin public library card (€10 annually) thus yanking ~€80 from the pockets of amazon and apple, or moving from Netlify to StaticHostEU for my deployment and hosting needs. I'm also planning to buy On Running shoes when my current pair of Nikes fall apart.</p>

<p>Beyond these modest changes I've been unable (or unwilling?) to find alternates that wouldn't severely (or mildly) inconvenience me. I've grown so comfortable and complacent and this post is a way to force myself to sit with the unease of knowing my virtues exist as mighty pillars in my mind but pool-noodles in reality.</p>

<p>On a more positive note, I'm working on my own simple e-invoicing web app that will eventually separate me from Freshbooks, and I'm making an effort to follow the discourse online, knowing I'm looking through the lens of someone who works in and around the tech industry. It has been refreshing to see that our innate interdependence is emerging as a core principle to build on top of.</p>

<p>Hopefully this swell of interest brings more players to the table, from hobby coders to governmental orgs, to build more open digital ecosystems that allow us to thrive without locking us in to milk us dry. This could be a welcome perk of the US's rapid fall into oligarchy and authoritarianism.</p>
